Problem Statement

Core Problems
1. **Meeting amnesia:** People forget what was discussed, promised, or decided
2. **Context switching:** Lost productivity from re-learning past conversations
3. **Knowledge silos:** Information trapped in individual memories
4. **Scale limitations:** Human memory doesn't scale with growing complexity

Solution Overview
What We're Building
An autonomous AI agent that:
1. **Listens** - Real-time audio capture via FastRTC
2. **Understands** - Entity extraction via Gemini 3 Pro Preview
3. **Remembers** - Knowledge graph storage via Neo4j
4. **Assists** - Proactive insights via MCP tools + Google ADK
5. **Visualizes** - Mind maps via Miro API

Key Differentiator
Not a passive transcription tool - an **active reasoning agent** that:
- Decides when to search history (autonomous via Google ADK)
- Warns about risks before they happen (proactive)
- Connects dots across conversations (intelligent)
